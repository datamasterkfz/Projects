# Unifty Titles

This is an assignment from one of my interviews. The objective is to unify titles provided in `raw_title` column in the Excel file `raw_titles.xlsx`.

Some sample unified title are provided in the first few rows in  `unified_title` column

In general, this small project is a good practice of text mining/cleaning. I had fun with it ðŸ˜†
