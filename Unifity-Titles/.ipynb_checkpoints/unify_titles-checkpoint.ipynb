    "\n",
    "The result is not 100% correct for now just by quickly glancing over it. Below are several things I noticed so far that I think could be improved in the future if I have more time\n",
    "\n",
    "**(1) The choose of root word**\n",
    "\n",
    "In my current algorithm, finding the unified title starts with locating the root word of a title. However, my way of locating the root word or even the current definition of root word is not perfect. There are quite a few titles that will be put with incorrect unified title due to this problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "- C AND C SIGNS AND GRAPHIC DESIGN INC\n",
    "- C AND H DISPOSAL SERVICE INC\n",
    "- C AND S SALES\n",
    "- C MAX MEDIA LLC\n",
    "\n",
    "None of the above titles should even be unified but my result produces that all of them have unified title of a single character `C`\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, a better definition of root word, or the way of finding the root word, or even another approach to tackle the problem is definitely worth developing if I want to improve the result\n",
    "\n",
    "**(2) More words to ignore** \n",
    "\n",
    "There are many other words that may worth being considered to remove when locating the root word. But since they are not as easy as `THE` to be determined as meaningless, I did not put them in the list of words to ignore\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are three examples I came across when glancing through my results\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `NEW`\n",
    "    - NEW FLYER INDUSTRIES CANADA ULC\n",
    "    - NEW PIG\n",
    "    - NEW RELIC INC (IOS)\n",
    "    - ...\n",
    "2. `NICE`\n",
    "    - NICE ACTIVE VOIP\n",
    "    - NICE PERFORM NPX\n",
    "    - NICE VISION  NET 2.5\n",
    "    - ...\n",

    "    - NORTH STAR\n",
    "    - NORTH STATES INDUSTRIES\n",
    "    - ...\n",
    "\n",
    "**(3) Add mapping between common abbreviations**\n",
    "\n",
    "I also notice that there are also some titles that are basically the same but some use abbreviations and some do not. Therefore, I think including a mapping between common abbreviations, such as `{'ASSOCIATION': ['ASSOC.','ASSN.']}`, will be helpful with correcting some wrong unifications.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, two titles below should have the same unified title but due to different use of abbreviations, I failed to produce the optimal results for them.\n",
    "\n",
    "- CENTRAL ASSOC. FOR THE BLIND\n",
    "- CENTRAL ASSOCIATION F/T BLIND\n",
    "\n",
    "**(4) Keep original special characters in the unitied title**\n",
    "\n",
    "When I was cleaning the raw title, I replaced all punctuations with single whitespace for simplification. However, some special characters may be wanted to remain in the unified title.\n",
